      <p>The crew aboard the Starship <em>Vanguard</em> had never experienced darkness quite like this. A routine mining route had turned into an abyss of silence the moment the final beacon went dark. The stars outside were still, indifferent. The hum of the ship, once comforting, now echoed like a whisper in a tomb. Even the air inside the command deck seemed heavier. Time, or the perception of it, stretched longer and thinner with every pulse of the vortex they had encountered. Crew members passed each other in hallways with blank expressions, their minds heavy with unspoken dread. Dreams turned into vivid hallucinations, blending memory with the unknown. The ship’s AI began flagging illogical movements, footsteps where no one walked, doors opening without a signal.</p>

      <p>Captain Rhea stared at the navigation console, its map flickering, confused. "This isn't just a system failure," she murmured. "It's as if the void itself reached in and took something." Lights flickered again. A distant clang echoed through the corridor, followed by a power dip. From the ship's outer cameras, they watched it: a glowing whirlpool in space. But it wasn’t pulling them in — it pulsed like a heartbeat. Lieutenant Mars, the engineer, whispered, "Ma’am, that anomaly... it's not natural. And it's not new. It was waiting for us." He pulled up archived data—readings from other lost expeditions in nearby systems—and the pattern was the same. This wasn’t the first contact. As they prepared for emergency thrust, the communications panel lit up. It wasn’t a distress call... it was a signal. Human. Coming from inside the vortex. Not a scream. A whisper. Repeating just one word: "Welcome."</p>
