      <p>Deep within the heart of the Andros, an anomaly had formed — a perfect sphere of distorted light hovering inside the engine core. It emitted no heat, no radiation, and yet pulled all reflections toward it. Mirrors warped. Crew faces changed subtly in security feeds. One by one, reflections ceased to mimic their hosts. First the eyes would stop blinking. Then smiles would freeze. Finally, they'd disappear altogether, leaving only a blank void in the glass. Rhea ordered the core sealed, but the reflections didn’t stay inside. They moved through any surface that once held light — visors, tablets, cups of water. Kali shattered every mirror she could find, sobbing with a sense of being watched from within herself.
      </p>

      <p>The physicist, Dr. Elan, argued it was a quantum signature — something ancient surfacing through fractured perception. But perception was failing fast. Crew began reporting memories they hadn’t lived: battles on red moons, sunsets under triple suns, birth aboard rings not charted on any star map. The ship’s AI, SCION, attempted to categorize these inconsistencies, only to corrupt its own core routines with fragmented language resembling dreams. As the reflections grew bolder, one phrase echoed from their mouths in mimicry: “We are not you, but we remember how to be.” The crew’s sanity was no longer measured in days, but in mirrors left unbroken.</p>
