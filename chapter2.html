      <p>The whisper repeated every 42 seconds. It was not a recording but a transmission loop, evolving slightly each time as if learning from itself. Captain Rhea and her crew tried triangulating the origin point within the vortex, but the calculations bent reality. Time-stamps began to desync across ship systems. Mars reported engine drift — even though they weren’t moving. The whisper had become embedded in the ship’s systems, trickling into every feed and log file like a digital ghost. Ensign Kali, the youngest member, claimed she saw a face in the reflection of the observation bay window — not hers. It smiled when she turned away.</p>

      <p>Medical logs grew erratic. Crew members began experiencing identical dreams, or so they thought — dreams of vast catacombs under alien stars, of a city buried in a nebula. It wasn’t until the botanist, Juno, began speaking in a long-dead Earth dialect that Rhea realized: this wasn’t just a transmission. It was a memory. Not human, not alien — something older. Something buried within the void itself. Something now waking. As the crew debated next steps, the whisper finally changed. It stopped repeating. This time, it said: "We remember you."</p>
