      <p>The vortex’s pull intensified, but the crew felt no acceleration. It was as if the space outside had bent to cradle the *Vanguard*. Rhea ordered a full systems scan. That’s when the internal motion sensors picked up anomalies. Someone—or something—was walking the lower maintenance corridors. But every visual feed showed emptiness. No shadows. No movement. Only audio—soft thuds in rhythm, and static laced with what sounded like whispers. Each time they played the recording backward, the pattern resembled a known language. But not Earth’s. Something older. A dialect lost to the stars.</p>

      <p>As the engineers explored the ship’s underbelly, they discovered imprints. Handprints. Dozens of them. Burned into the cold steel of the wall. One was labeled with the serial number of their ship—but inverted and decades older than their model. The science officer, Elin, analyzed it. "These aren’t just visitors. They’re us. Or versions of us, failed before, looped again." She trembled. Time was not moving linearly here. The crew’s memories began overlapping—dreams turning into recollections they didn’t own. Conversations from the past played back on speakers. Footage showed crew members walking halls they hadn’t stepped in yet. The ship wasn’t haunted—it was remembering itself. And somewhere in the folds of metal and time, something watched... from within their own future.</p>
