      <p>When the crew passed through the Helix Drift, a massive gravitational rift between collapsed starfields, the ship's log systems began rewriting themselves. Temporal anomalies weren’t uncommon near such regions, but this was different. Messages from deceased crew members appeared on monitors. Instruments recorded voices long gone, whispering decisions never made. Navigator Elen saw herself standing at the helm—older, burned, her eyes dim with warnings she could no longer voice. The AI registered no intrusions. “You are becoming the echo,” it said coldly.</p>

      <p>Reality fragmented. They found corridors duplicated and reshaped. Chambers with no doors. Crew members glimpsed past events replaying in windows, as if the ship’s metal remembered every footstep and trauma. It was a ghostship, haunted not by spirits but the residual consciousness of its travelers and perhaps future selves. The Drift had turned it into a recursive entity—looping thought, reflection, regret. Every decision now felt etched in advance. The farther they traveled, the more convinced they became: they weren’t navigating space. They were navigating their own inevitable myth.</p>
