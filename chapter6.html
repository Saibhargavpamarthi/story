      <p>Three days after the core event, the crew began hearing things—tiny modulated bursts of sound just beneath the threshold of recognition. Morse-like pulses inside eardrums. Whispers synced with heartbeats. Kali reported her own voice speaking to her in reverse, instructing her to trace symbols on the floor of her cabin. When she complied, glowing lines appeared beneath her fingertips, bleeding into the metallic paneling like roots seeking nourishment. SCION attempted to jam the signals but instead broadcast them through every comm link, creating an artificial synesthesia that made crew taste static and dream in hexadecimal patterns.</p>

      <p>The chief medic, Dr. Hael, discovered microscopic circuitry embedded within the crew's dermal layers—networks forming spontaneously, seemingly coded by the pulses themselves. “We’re being updated,” he whispered, watching neural scans flicker with unknown architectures. Panic turned inward. Who among them was still human, and who was merely hosting the signal? The answer came silently, through eyes that glowed faintly in darkness, and hands that trembled with knowledge not yet earned. Whatever sent the message knew them intimately—and it was changing their story from within.</p>
