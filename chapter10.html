      <p>The ship had reached the terminal frontier. Beyond the Derelict Belt, silence no longer implied emptiness—it suggested judgment. The stars themselves were withdrawing, curling away like burnt paper in a windless room. Even the AI fell into recursive memory loops, repeating old instructions in desperate clarity. The remaining crew, now reduced to six, held their breath each hour, afraid even thought might trigger cosmic awareness. “You’re being watched,” the engineer whispered, though no instruments confirmed it. Space felt heavier than gravity allowed. The universe was listening.</p>

      <p>In the final hour, a door opened—within the ship, not constructed but revealed. Its interior pulsed like a slow, breathing lung, humming a tune that bypassed ears and reached memory. They stepped in one by one, not to escape, but to join whatever awaited. And as the last human crossed the threshold, the vessel dissolved into streaks of fading memory. Nothing returned. No black box. No distress call. Just silence. But travelers swear the stars near that region flicker in strange rhythms, like Morse from the dead. A requiem written not in sound—but in starlight.</p>
