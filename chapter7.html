      <p>They breached the edge of the black anomaly, its curvature forming a borderless wall of shimmering distortion. There was no sensation of speed—only the unraveling of expectations. Time stretched like elastic, thoughts slowed into syrup, and memories rearranged themselves as if shuffled by an unseen intelligence. The ship’s AI registered non-Euclidean vectors. Crew members reported déjà vu of moments not yet lived, voices whispering personal regrets in languages they had never spoken. The anomaly was more than gravitational—it was sentient, a filter that sieved reality and intention alike.</p>

      <p>When they emerged, the stars were different. No recognizable constellations. SCION identified temporal dissonance in the cosmic background radiation. They had arrived at a place not in space, but in perspective. In this new quadrant, physics sang in different keys. Light bent in harmony, colors formed chords. The event horizon had not only relocated them—it had redefined their fundamental understanding of what it meant to observe. And deep within the darkness, a structure floated—too regular to be natural, too vast to be of human origin. The mission was no longer exploration. It was survival in a rewritten cosmos.</p>
