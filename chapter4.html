      <p>As the rift pulsed in the distance, its crack widened, revealing what looked like threads of glowing matter, webbing across the stars like nerves exposed from a ruptured cosmos. The ship's gravitational sensors surged beyond thresholds, and alarms chimed in rhythmic chaos. No longer simply a tear in spacetime, the rift now throbbed like a living wound — bleeding frequencies that didn’t belong to this universe. Commander Vex theorized it might not be a rift at all but a mouth, yawning wider to speak. And speak it did — with static, with symbols scrawled across control panels, with hallucinations only some could see. The ship’s walls felt thinner. Rooms began shifting slightly, doors opening into impossible loops of corridor.

      <p>Juno collapsed again, her blood now magnetic to the instruments. Her brain scans mapped an alien topography — cities, monoliths, and beings of silver thread. One deck below, crewman Aul inspected a maintenance duct only to vanish in front of two witnesses. What returned three minutes later had Aul's eyes, but no fingerprints, no heartbeat. It smiled like the whisper did. Captain Rhea ordered a quarantine on Deck D, but it was too late. The rift didn’t just leak — it was spilling. And what spilled was learning how to imitate curiosity. The crew wasn't exploring the unknown anymore. The unknown was now exploring them.</p>
